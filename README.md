# Knapsack-problem

## Introduction
Knapsack problem is a NP-complete problem that aims to find a set of items that total weight is less than or equal to a given limit and the total value is as large as possible.  
Ant Colony Optimaization is a metaheuristik algorithm that inspired from behavior of ant colonies.It's a multi agent intelligent system for solving some problems. This optimization algorithm 
can solve the problems that represented as a graph.
This repository was a homework in AI course, and after few years attracted my attention when I started studying about cloud resource management and saw knapsack problem as resource allocation problem.
